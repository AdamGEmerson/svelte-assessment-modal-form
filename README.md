# Quick Svelte Assessment

Create a quick demo that implements a modal and a global store to manage a list of usernames.

## Requirements

* Modal should be able to be opened from any page.
* Modal should update a global store holding all usernames.
* One of the pages should display the list of usernames.
* Stub out the modal submit handler as if it will call a REST API later.
* You cannot use form actions (must be treated as an SPA).
